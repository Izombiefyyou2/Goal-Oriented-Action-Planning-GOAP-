# Goal Oriented Action Planning
It has always intruiged me how a games AI does its decision making. From deciding where to walk around to choosing between attacking or holding their ground.
So for this project I decided to research one of the many ways it can be handled, namely Goal Oriented Action Planning. <br />
Next to that there's also others I'd like to compare GOAP to, like Hierarchical Task Network Planning A.K.A HTN, to see what the pros and cons between them are. <br />
Using the information I get during my research I will try to create my own implementation of it.
## Existing Games
A very known game that uses G.O.A.P is F.E.A.R, a first person action horror game from 2005.<br />
